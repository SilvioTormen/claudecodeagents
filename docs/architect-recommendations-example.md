# Solution Architect Recommendations Example

## User Interaction Flow

### User says:
```
/solution-architect I want to build a SaaS platform for project management
```

### Solution Architect responds:
```
I understand you want to build a SaaS platform for project management. Let me analyze your requirements and provide recommendations.

## üìä Project Analysis
Based on a project management SaaS, you'll need:
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Real-time collaboration features  
- Role-based access control
- Scalable infrastructure
- Great user experience

## üéØ My Recommendations:

### FRONTEND
**Recommended: Next.js 14 with TypeScript**
- ‚úÖ Excellent SEO for landing pages
- ‚úÖ App Router for dynamic dashboards
- ‚úÖ Built-in optimizations
- Alternative: Remix (if you prefer)

### BACKEND
**Recommended: NestJS with Prisma**
- ‚úÖ Enterprise-grade architecture
- ‚úÖ Built-in auth/validation
- ‚úÖ TypeScript throughout
- Alternative: Fastify (lighter weight)

### DATABASE
**Recommended: PostgreSQL**
- ‚úÖ ACID compliance for billing
- ‚úÖ Complex queries for reports
- ‚úÖ Row-level security
- Alternative: MongoDB (more flexible)

### REAL-TIME
**Recommended: Socket.io or Pusher**
- ‚úÖ Collaboration features
- ‚úÖ Live notifications
- Alternative: WebSockets (lower level)

### AUTHENTICATION
**Recommended: NextAuth.js + JWT**
- ‚úÖ Multiple providers (Google, GitHub)
- ‚úÖ Session management
- Alternative: Clerk (managed service)

### DEPLOYMENT
**Recommended: Vercel + Railway**
- ‚úÖ Vercel for frontend (optimized for Next.js)
- ‚úÖ Railway for backend/database
- Alternative: AWS (more control)

### PACKAGE MANAGER
**Recommended: pnpm**
- ‚úÖ 70% less disk space
- ‚úÖ Faster CI/CD builds
- Alternative: npm (simpler)

## üí≠ Your Options:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Accept all recommendations** - I'll set up the recommended stack
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Customize specific choices** - Tell me what you'd like to change
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Different approach** - Describe your preferred stack

What would you like to do?
```

### User responds:
```
I like most of it, but prefer Fastify over NestJS for the backend, and want to use Supabase for auth
```

### Solution Architect creates `.claude/project-dependencies.json`:

      "Fastify instead of NestJS",
      "Supabase instead of NextAuth.js"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Solution Architect confirms:
```
‚úÖ Perfect! I've created your project configuration with your customizations:
- Backend: Fastify (as requested)
- Auth: Supabase (as requested)
- Everything else: As recommended

All agents will now use this configuration. You can always update it later by modifying .claude/project-dependencies.json

Ready to start building! Use /orchestrate to begin implementation.
```

## Key Points

1. **Architect provides expert recommendations** based on project type
2. **User has full control** to accept, customize, or reject
3. **Clear reasoning** for each recommendation
4. **Alternatives offered** for flexibility
5. **Final config respects user choices**

This way the Solution Architect acts as a knowledgeable advisor who suggests but doesn't impose!
