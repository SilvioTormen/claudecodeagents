# Claude Code AI Agents Collection 🤖

A collection of specialized AI agents for Claude Code, available as slash commands after installation.

## 🚀 Quick Installation

```bash
# Direct from GitHub
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SilvioTormen/claudecodeagents/main/setup-claude-agents.sh | bash

# Or clone and install
git clone https://github.com/SilvioTormen/claudecodeagents.git
cd claudecodeagents
./setup-claude-agents.sh
```

**Important:** Agents are installed as slash commands to:
- `.claude/commands/` (project-specific)
- `~/.claude/commands/` (global for all projects)

## 🌟 NEW: Automatic Team Communication System

All agents now automatically document their work for perfect team collaboration! When agents work on your project, they create documentation in `.claude/agent-communication/` that other agents read and use.

### How It Works
1. **Backend builds API** → Documents endpoints in `backend-api-spec.md`
2. **Frontend reads docs** → Knows exactly how to integrate
3. **Frontend needs feature** → Documents in `frontend-requirements.md`  
4. **Backend implements** → Updates API spec
5. **Perfect integration!** No guessing, no miscommunication

### Communication Files Created
```
.claude/agent-communication/
├── backend-api-spec.md         # API endpoints and examples
├── frontend-components.md       # UI components and usage
├── database-schema.md          # Database structure
├── deployment-guide.md         # How to deploy
├── security-requirements.md    # Security policies
├── test-scenarios.md          # What to test
└── team-status.md             # Overall project status
```
